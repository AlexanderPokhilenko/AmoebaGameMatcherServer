The project performs two subtasks: a matchmaker and a profile server.
- The Matchmaker sets up teams of players who are looking for a match. After forming a team of players, a request is sent to the game server (unity 3d) to create a new match.
- The profile server is responsible for registration, storage of data about the player's resources, storage of data about the match of the player, maintenance of the in-game store, checking purchases for real currency.
